## hi, I'm Maria! 👋🏻

I am a Computer Science student currently based in Juiz de Fora (MG), Brazil.       
my pronouns are **she/her** and you can talk to me in portuguese or english (hopefully also in german, in the very distant future).

  💼 | I'm a RPA developer at [Smarthis](https://smarthis.com/) 
  
  💻 | I'm currently studying vehicle routing problems with drones 
  
  💖 | I'm a volunteer at [Meninas Digitais UFJF](https://www.instagram.com/meninasdigitaisufjf/), trying to increase the number of girls in STEM
  
  👀 | in my repositories you'll probably find stuff I used to study and my (very few) personal projects  
  
  📧 | you can reach me at marialuisa@ice.ufjf.br or at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-lu%C3%ADsa-riolino-guimar%C3%A3es/) | [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marialuisarg_/)

✨ besides tech, I love to talk about books, travel, food and everything related to pop culture! ✨
